# FCAF assertion review backlog

This is the dedicated worklist for source tests that have no Credimi definition,
and for defined tests whose assertions remain pending or blocked. The tests that
already have a definition remain in the generated aggregate pipeline;
completing an item means reviewing its source scenario, pipeline evidence, and
assertions rather than removing it from execution.

Review baseline: the local source mirror under
`config_templates/fcaf_sources/wallet_solution/relying_party/`, cross-checked
against upstream `submitted` commit `2b223b56be0d0a073ee0cdc9db1d7fd31d9529a1`
(13/08/2026), and the Capture Wallet contract in
`pkg/fcaf/CAPTURE_WALLET_API.md`. The source mirror has 621 distinct
`WS_RP_*` files and Credimi has 559 matching test definitions. The 62-file
difference is listed below; it is deliberately separate from assertion work
that is incomplete or incorrect.

Total: 377 source/backlog items (62 unimplemented source tests, 45 newly
pending, 8 pending, 190 blocked, and 72 done).

## Unimplemented source tests

These source test files have no matching file in
`config_templates/fcaf/wallet_solution/relying_party/tests/`; no Credimi
scenario, evidence binding, or assertion is claimed for them. `_UF` is retained
where it is part of the upstream source-test identifier.

## New pending

These tests have a request shape and evidence path under the beta Capture
Wallet contract that the earlier review did not have. Each still needs a
source-specific scenario and a live Wallet run; this category is not a
conformance-pass claim.

### Reclassified from verifier blocked

#### Plain redirect-URI, signing-prefix, and metadata coverage

- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages__038` (unsigned `redirect_uri:` request with `request_delivery: plain`)
- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_Metadata__111` (signed `x509_hash`, `x509_san_dns`, or `decentralized_identifier` request)
- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_Metadata__125` (valid `x509_san_dns` binding using the service certificate)
- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_Metadata__127` (matching `x509_san_dns` and redirect-URI host)
- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_Metadata__129` (valid default `x509_hash` certificate-hash binding)
- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_Metadata__131` (request signed by the default x509 leaf key)
- [ ] `WS_RP_IA_Metadata__015` (published `decentralized_identifier` DID document and client metadata)
- [ ] `WS_RP_IA_Metadata__016` (empty replacement `client_metadata` in a `direct_post` session)

#### Request-URI and response transport evidence

- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages__047` (published request-URI response media type and signed request object)
- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages__129` (captured compact JWE response exposes the protected `kid` header)
- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages__130` (replacement `client_metadata`, retaining the generated encryption JWK, can select response encryption parameters)
- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages__131` (captured compact JWE response exposes the default `enc` header)
- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages__133` (raw response capture includes HTTP method)
- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages__134` (raw response capture includes form body and redacted headers)
- [ ] `WS_RP_IA_MainInteraction__049` (raw response capture proves form-encoded `direct_post.jwt`)
- [ ] `WS_RP_IA_MainInteraction__052` (raw response capture preserves the exact UTF-8 form body)
- [ ] `WS_RP_IA_MainInteraction__054` (raw response capture proves POST delivery)

#### Callback and request-shape controls

- [ ] `WS_RP_IA_MainInteraction__057` (successful callback can return the configured redirect URI)
- [ ] `WS_RP_IA_MainInteraction__061` (successful callback returns a no-store JSON redirect response)
- [ ] `WS_RP_IA_MainInteraction__067` (successful callback can supply the redirect URI the Wallet must open)
- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages__137` (unknown scope with `dcql_query: null`)
- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages__138` (malformed scope with `dcql_query: null`)
- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages__139` (empty scope with `dcql_query: null`)
- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages__140` (empty-scope termination, captured through the response record)
- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages__142` (no scope and `dcql_query: null`)
- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages__150` (unsupported format query and captured Wallet error)

### Reclassified from pending

These cases had partial Credimi work but lacked a documented evidence route.
The beta verifier now provides the relevant signed-request or raw-response
surface. Replacement-metadata cases require an initial session probe to
confirm the exact resulting Request Object before an assertion is implemented.

#### Request integrity and response encryption

- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_RpIntegrity__006` (DID signing key published in the service `did:web` document)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_RpIntegrity__013` (valid signed X.509 request)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_RpIntegrity__016` (valid X.509 request and trust-chain evidence)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_RpIntegrity__018` (valid `x509_hash` request and trust-chain evidence)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_RpIntegrity__020` (valid `x509_hash` request with replacement client metadata)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_RpIntegrity__023` (accepted signed `x509_hash` request)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_RpIntegrity__028` (unsigned plain request)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_RpIntegrity__029` (default signed request)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_RpIntegrity__031` (default ES256-signed request)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_SessionEncryption__001` (captured encrypted `direct_post.jwt` response)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_SessionEncryption__002` (generated or replacement verifier JWK)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_SessionEncryption__003` (captured JWE algorithm and selected JWK)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_SessionEncryption__005` (captured JWE protected header)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_SessionEncryption__007` (captured A128GCM response encryption)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_SessionEncryption__008` (replacement metadata can request A256GCM)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_SessionEncryption__009` (replacement metadata can advertise both supported `enc` values)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_SessionEncryption__011` (captured response key identifier can be compared with the request metadata)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_SessionEncryption__012` (published `direct_post.jwt` response encryption)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SH_Encoding_TextualEncoding_022` (raw presentation-response body preserves UTF-8 form encoding)

## Pending

These tests have the necessary service boundary, but their scenario and
assertion design still need review. They are not blocked by a missing Capture
Wallet capability.

- [ ] `WS_RP_SH_Encoding_TextualEncoding_008`
- [ ] `WS_RP_SH_Encoding_TextualEncoding_011`
- [ ] `WS_RP_SH_Encoding_TextualEncoding_017`
- [ ] `WS_RP_SH_Encoding_TextualEncoding_018`
- [ ] `WS_RP_SH_Encoding_TextualEncoding_019`
- [ ] `WS_RP_SH_Encoding_TextualEncoding_020`
- [ ] `WS_RP_SH_Encoding_TextualEncoding_021`
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_IssuerIntegrity__014`

## Blocked

The beta contract supplies only the capabilities documented in
`CAPTURE_WALLET_API.md`. These items require an input, credential fixture,
transport capture, Wallet profile, or verifier behavior that remains absent.

### Reclassified from pending

- [ ] `WS_RP_IA_MainInteraction__041` (requires two same-type credentials with distinct values; no such issuer fixture is published)
- [ ] `WS_RP_IA_Metadata__012` (requires Static Discovery with a controlled SIOPv2 `aud`; it is not a supported client identifier scheme)
- [ ] `WS_RP_IA_Metadata__013` (requires a controlled invalid Static Discovery `aud`; it is not a supported client identifier scheme)
- [ ] `WS_RP_IA_Supportive__006` (requires deliberately exhausting the Wallet device; this is neither a verifier nor an issuer capability)
- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages__095` (requires an ETSI trusted-list fixture and Wallet trust-list resolution)
- [ ] `WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages__151` (requires an unsupported mdoc format, while the reference Wallet supports `mso_mdoc`)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_IssuerIntegrity__012` (requires an mdoc revocation fixture; Capture publishes Token Status List allocation, not an ISO mdoc revocation fixture)

### Signature, trust, and Digital Credentials API controls

- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_RpIntegrity__015` (requires an X.509 request signed by a key outside its `x5c` leaf)
- [ ] `WS_RP_SM_RpIntegrity__017` (requires an incomplete or untrusted X.509 chain)

### Issuer status-list control

`status_list_enabled` now allocates a Token Status List reference, but the
published contract does not expose control over credential format, status-list
claim omission, index encoding, URI encoding, or the CBOR map shape required by
